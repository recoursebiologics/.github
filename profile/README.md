# Recourse Biologics

**Official GitHub Organization for Recourse Biologics** ‚Äî advancing first-in-class immunotherapeutics for oncology.

## üß¨ About Us

Recourse Biologics is committed to advancing precision therapeutics for oncology. Our lead molecule is **RB101**. RB101 is a first-in-class immunotherapeutic that increases professional killer cell persistence, memory formation, and cytotoxicity without systemic toxicity or exhaustion. RB101 is 12 months from IND.

In addition to RB101, Recourse Biologics has created a pipeline of compelling, first-in-class candidates. This includes validated ADCs directed at novel tumor-selective targets, and an improved method of targeting and redirecting cytotoxic lymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment using our **bispecific antibody platform**.
